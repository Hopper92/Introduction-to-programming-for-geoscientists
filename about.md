This is a 1<sup>st</sup> year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by Gerard Gorman and Nicolas Barral at Imperial College London. The course has two objectives:

* Learn the basic principles of computer programming. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is currently one of the [most popular introductary teaching languages](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) and is an excellent gateway to learning other computing languages that you may encounter as your career develops.
* Become proficient and productive in Python. It is heavily used in geoscience and you will encounter it many times during your studies, particularly in project work.

The lectures notes are written in [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document.
