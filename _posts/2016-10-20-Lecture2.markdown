The lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly
using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/blob/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)
or [download the notebook
here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)
(Note: you may need to right-click and use *Save Link As...*).

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please
revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.

This lecture does have quite a bit of material in it. We are going to
monitor progress closely and most likely split it across the next 2 weeks
to ensure you have time to get through all the exercises.
