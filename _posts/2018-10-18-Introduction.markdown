## "What is the course about?"

This is a 1<sup>st</sup> year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by
[Nicolas Barral](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.barral) and 
[Gerard Gorman](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman). It is designed to
be a first introduction to computer programming.  No previous knowledge of
computer programming, or indeed computing, is assumed.  We will be covering
core concepts in programming which you will be able to reapply to any other
programming language that you are likely to encounter in the future.

The lectures notes are written in [Jupyter
notebooks](https://jupyter.org/about.html) " which is an open source project was
born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive
data science and scientific computing across all programming languages." It is
a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code
execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. In
short, it's what all the cool kids are using these days for computational and
data science.

## "I did not sign up for computer science - why on earth am I doing this?"

You might be asking as a geoscientist why on earth are you learning to program.
You were expecting exciting field trips etc., not hours squinting at a computer
screen. The fact is that computing and at least basic programming are crucial
skills in nearly all fields of modern science and engineering. It has many uses
in data analysis, simulation and prediction. Irrespective of what area you
pursue in geoscience, you will need to do somewhere between a little and a lot
of programming. Ultimately, with just the right set of basic skills, you can
automate all the tedious work and get to focus on the actual
geoscience/geophysics.

## "Hey, the lecturer is not lecturing us!"

Let's get this straight because it comes up every year - for a number
of reasons I will not be standing in front, talking *at* you, for 3
hours each week. This worries some students because it does not align
with the common notion of what a lecture entails. So let me explain...

[For starters, in the best of circumstances the adult student can maintain
focus for 15-20
minutes](http://ixil.izt.uam.mx/pd/lib/exe/fetch.php/ib:modconduccion:the_change_up_in_lectures.pdf).
Then you need refreshing or resetting. Sure you may sit passively for much
longer and think you are learning/being taught but the scientific evidence says
you are working sub-optimally and spend significant periods zoned out or
updating facebook. Secondly, passive learning simply does not work for this
course no more than it would work for learning to cycle. Computing programming
is a *practical* skill and you mostly learn by doing it yourself. On the plus
side the learning experience usually results in fewer injuries than when you
learned to cycle.

For this reason we apply a form of [blended
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning). All the course
material is online and you are expected to have read through the relevant
material before a lecture. Let's face it - you do not need me to read to you.
The face-to-face lecture is based in the computer lab. There we will have a
series of ~10 minute lectures to establish context/motivation, run through live
examples and explore issues raised by you, the students. Most of the time you
will be working through the exercises that make use of the concepts introduced
in the lecture material. This should be a highly interactive experience with
your peers (sometimes the best person to explain something is someone who just
learned it themselves, as they are closer to your perspective), teaching
assistants (we have a really good GTA/student ratio so make use of them!) and
lecturer. While I have suggested a text book which you may choose to read
sections of for greater understanding and entertainment - *the critical aspect
of the course is to complete these exercises*. Just ask the students in the
years ahead of you.

## The exam

The exam for this course will also similarly involve a set of programming
exercises. It is done in the lab just before we break for Christmas and is open
book. If you do all the exercises then you can expect the exam to be trivial -
last year 50% got above 70%. On the other hand if you do not to the exercises,
chances are you will fail (there are things you just cannot sugar coat).

## Why Python? Why not [insert whatever language] instead?

Python is a modern, general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is
widely used in science and engineering and overall has a significant share of
the programming market share - it has even topped [2017's most popular
programming
list](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/252987-python-tops-list-2017s-popular-programming-languages).
It is also one of the [most popular introductary teaching
languages](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext).
If you need more convincing then take a look at job adverts and see what
employers are looking for... Its advantages are:

* Simplicity: It is easy to read and easy to learn.
* Expressive: Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs and easy to maintain.
* Powerful: Python is not a language you grow out of. It can also be used for large projects, Big Data, High Performance Computing applications, etc.

## Course material

All the course notes are online. Sample solutions to the exercises will be made
available after each lecture. If you miss a lecture (short of an alien invasion
this shouldn't happen of course) then make an earnest attempt at the exercises
before reading the solution or you will deprive yourself of the learning
experience. Let me say this a second time as it is another one of those talking
points that comes up every year; seeing Mark Cavendish cycle on TV doesn't mean
you magically learn to cycle...

## Supplementary material

This course loosely follows the text book [A Primer on Scientific Programming
with Python, by Hans Petter
Langtangen](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642302920).
There are many copies of the book in the library and a
[PDF](https://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/half/book.pdf) online. As
explained above, you do not have to read this book to excel in this course as
the online course material is self contained. However, it is a good resource if
you want to broaden your understanding of the subject.

One size does not fit all. Therefore, I encourage you to browse a few different
resources suggested by students over the years (see below) which might appeal
to your learning habits. Just remember to always go back and do the exercises
to ensure we are all on the same page.

* [Python](http://www.python.org>). The official Python web site.
* [Python tutorials](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/). The official Python tutorials.
