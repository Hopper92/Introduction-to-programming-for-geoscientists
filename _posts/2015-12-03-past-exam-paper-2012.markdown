The 2012 and 2014 exams are now available (see the link below). Again, it is recommended that you complete it in one sitting, so you can time yourself.

Just like all the lectures the exam will be written in IPython notebook format (this is not the case for the 2012 exam). You should make sure you can add cells to write your solutions.

* 2012 class test: [view](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/python_class_test_2012.ipynb) [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/python_class_test_2012.ipynb). Note that you already have the files `constants.txt` and `density_air.dat`.
* 2014 class test: [view](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/python_class_test_2014.ipynb) [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/python_class_test_2014.ipynb). You will also need download the data files [human_evolution.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/data/human_evolution.txt) and [seismic.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/data/seismic.dat).
