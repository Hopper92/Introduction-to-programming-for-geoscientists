A few of you have asked to see a past exam paper. I have made the 2013 exam available (see the link below). It is recommended that you complete it in one sitting, so you can time yourself. Some topics (e.g. on reading/writing files, and classes and objects) necessary to complete all the past exam questions will be covered in class over the next 2 weeks, so please do not attempt the past exam yet unless you (a) have read ahead and feel happy with all of the lecture notes and (b) have completed all of the exercises.

Just like all the lectures the exam will be written in IPython notebook format. You should make sure you can add cells to write your solutions.

You will also need to download the data file

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTAs.
