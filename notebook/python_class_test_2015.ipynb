      "* You can write an explanation of your solution as comments in your code.\n",
      "* You should work with the two data files (VostokStation.txt and last_months_earthquakes.csv) in their original form. They must **not** be modified.\n",
      "* In each case your solution program must fulfil all of the instructions - please check the instructions carefully and double check that your program fulfils all of the given instructions.\n",
      "* Save your work regularly.\n",
      "* At the end of the test you should email your IPython notebook document (i.e. this document) to [Christian T. Jacobs](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.jacobs10) at c.jacobs10@imperial.ac.uk **and also** [Gerard J. Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman) at g.gorman@imperial.ac.uk"
