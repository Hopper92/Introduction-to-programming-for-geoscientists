Welcome to this introductory computer programming course for geoscientists. Here you
will find a series of lectures focused on learning to program using
a language called <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. So that we can purely focus on learning to
program we will be using <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter Notebook</a>
which is a friendly "web-based interactive computational environment where you
can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document". This will allow us to develop and execute our programs alongside the lecture notes, instead of having to switch between the two.
<br/><br/>
The full lecture series can be accessed <a href="lecture_series">here</a> if you are
revising or want to forge ahead. Otherwise follow the series of posts below
each week as we make our way through the material.
